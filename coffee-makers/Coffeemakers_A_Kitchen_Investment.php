If you love your coffee in the morning, then you probably appreciate a good old coffee maker at home. Instant coffee may suffice too, but nothing beats the freshly brewed goodness brought by boiling water and ground beans. Instant powdered coffee is only acceptable when you are in camp and that is highly unlikely. Most household kitchens feature the usual small sized drip machine that can make about four great cups of coffee. <br>
<br>
There are those individuals with discerning tastes that would like to have authentic coffee made at home. They can get their fancy caffeine from commercial coffee chains and restaurants, but they sure would love to duplicate it in their own kitchen. It is not very difficult, all you need is more than a drip machine though, and a lot of confidence.<br>
<br>
First of all, a great cup of coffee is a result of well purchased and ground coffee beans. You can purchase the beans from your most frequented coffee store. Invest in a good coffee grinder and take the time to read the manuals. The grind setting of your grinder must match the preferred grind of your purchased beans. It is always indicated on the label so you must keep the label. <br>
<br>
Another kitchen investment for a coffee enthusiast would be a set of drip and espresso machine with a steamer wand. Drip coffee is alright for flavored cafes, especially if you prefer more coffee than milk or creamer. Espresso, however, is a single ounce versatile ingredient that can add flavour to any dessert or beverage. Espresso extracts can also be used for ice cream and bakery goods. Remember though, that espresso machines may only be used with espresso beans. Using any other coffee roast will result to a substandard coffee taste. The drip machine is not very meticulous; any other coffee roast can be brewed on it. <br>
<br>
A steam wand is a great treasure in the kitchen. It can produce froth out of milk for cappuccinos and lattes and even for pastries. It can also be used to reheat coffee instead of a microwave oven. Milk or creamer is always better tasting when steamed than boiled, because boiling reduces the liquid and changes the flavour.<br>
<br>
When purchasing a personal drip and espresso machine with steam wand, it is necessary to connect it to the filtered water valve. This machine maintains a certain temperature and utilises pressurised water. The temperature valve must be calibrated to ensure that its boiling point is neither lukewarm nor scalding hot. <br>
<br>
If you are adventurous in the kitchen then it would be great for you to own one of these fancy machines. Some people are not aware that fancy coffee can also be made at home with just the right equipment. And the correct equipment are already available because of the great demand and the growing number of consumers who have taken the courage to mix their own treat. Gone are the days of the percolating coffee maker that produces bitter and grainy liquid. <br>
