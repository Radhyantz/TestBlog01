You can brew your cup of coffee in a variety of manners and ways. Every method has unique traits to match different tastes, preferences, and lifestyles. But what all coffee makers have in common is that they brew your favorite drink without the need to boil coffee in a separate container. The amount of coffee that you can make depends on the size of the filter, the water container, and the carafe that holds the finished coffee. <br>
<br>
Choosing a coffee maker is a matter of features, price, preferences, and brand. These factors, along with what you really need from your coffee maker, should be considered when selecting a coffee maker that will best fit your needs. Among the types of coffee makers and their advantages are: <br>
<br>
• Drip Coffee Makers<br>
This type of coffee makers comes in 4 to 12 cup capacities. It is also available in various designs and models at different prices. This is, in general, the most economical type of coffee maker. The 10 and 12-cup coffee makers are among the most popular units in this type. Smaller models are also made available for small families. For hotels and dormitories, 4-cup coffee makers are ideal.<br>
<br>
If you’re purchasing a drip coffee maker, you need to make a choice between glass and thermal carafe. You can also prefer models designed for dripping right into a travel mug. This is the most popular type of brewer that even non-coffee drinkers can get just so they have an available coffee maker for guest serving. This can be the type that’s best for people looking for a practical brewer.<br>
<br>
• Percolators<br>
This is once the standard coffee brewer. There are people who claimed that it brews richer and tastier coffee than drip models. However, percolators come in limited designs and capacity choices. The common design for individuals who wish to percolate the coffee grounds is glass type percolators which are aimed for stove-top use. But the most popular design for such type of coffee maker is the electric brewer that features automatic settings. <br>
<br>
• French Coffee Press<br>
It has been in the industry for a considerable period of time. This brewer works by pushing the coffee grounds into the boiling water to make darker and richer coffee. The disadvantage of such design is it produces smaller capacity and cooktop brewing requires monitoring. <br>
<br>
• Single pod or One cup Coffee Makers<br>
In this type, the tea and coffee pod is positioned in the basket. The water coming from the reservoir drops through the pod, to the coffee cup. While this brewer is great in preparing clean specialty teas, coffees, lattes, and herbal beverages, the amount of drink it produces may not be enough for bigger families.<br>
<br>
• Specialty Brewers<br>
Coffee machines that prepare lattes, espresso, or cappuccino are usually priced higher than standard coffee makers. These brewers have functions and features that allow users to produce specialty coffees. There are also units that are capable of making regular coffee, making them practical enough for daily use. Among the things you should take into account when purchasing specialty coffee makers are serving capacity, type of brewing, physical size, and function.   <br>
